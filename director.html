						<h1>Directors Intent</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Michael Bay put a lot of effort into making the robots in Transformers look complex. In an interview he says, “I wanted them not to be clunky, lumbering robots. I looked at a lot of kung fu movies. I wanted them to have a different type of movement”[2]. Bay saw the Transformers as a way of “reinventing super heroes” which is why the robots needed to be relatable to the audience and able to convey emotion and personality [2].</p>
					<p>Reportedly, while the movie was being made 39,000 people were trying to hack Michael Bay’s computers to see the movie script and the appearance of the new Transformers [1]. Many images got leaked and fans of the original Transformers animated series were unhappy about the look of the new Transformers [1]. Consequently, Bay recieved a lot of backlash and even death threats [2]. However, Bay stuck to his own idea of what Transformers should look like on the big screen because he believed that simply blowing up the cartoon characters would be “the equivalent of ‘Ghostbusters’ with the Marshmallow man” [2].</p>
					<p>Despite their mechanical appearance, Michael Bay’s Transformers were still able to convey emotions through their facial expressions. In an interview, Bay says he gave the Transformers lips because “we did a lot of facial studies, and emotion is so hard without that kind of movement” [2]. An important aspect of Transformers is the emotional connection between the Autobots and the human characters, Sam and Mikaela. The anthropomorphic form of the Transformers plays an important role in strengthening the audience’s emotional connection to the Autobots and making Sam’s friendship with the Autobots more convincing.</p>
