						<h1>Intellectual Property</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Intellectual property rights is not a major theme in the movie Transformers. The Allspark, which is the cube that the Autobots are fighting to keep out of the hands of the Decepticons, could be considered as a piece of intellectual property belonging to whoever invented it. However, in the film’s introduction we learn that the Allspark was created before time began and the Autobots do not know where the Allspark came from. Since the Allspark was not created on Earth and it was created long before any patent laws were established in the United States, it is safe to assume the Allspark was not an invention protected by U.S. intellectual property laws. </p>
					<p>One reference to intellectual property rights is in the scene where Maggie and Glen are being interrogated by the FBI (timestamp 1:08:20). Glen tries to prove his innocence by saying “I have done nothing bad in my entire life!...so what? I’ve downloaded a couple thousand songs off the internet. Who hasn’t?”. Glen is correct that a lot of people illegally download music, especially around the time when Transformers came out in 2007. Illegal music downloads have resulted in many lost sales for the music industry and from 1999 to 2009 total revenue from music sales dropped from $14.6 billion to $6.3 billion [1]. Although many people illegally download music, the Recording Industry Association of America was still able to sue individuals for doing so. For example, in 2009 a single mother, Jammie Thomas-Rassert, was ordered to pay $1.92 million for violating copyrights of 24 songs [2]. Downloading music illegally may not be something the FBI would be interrogating Glen for, but Glen’s assumption that illegally downloading music is innocent just because many other people do it would not hold up in court.</p>
