						<h1>Chapter 4: Intellectual Property</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Megatron was secretly kept in cryostasis in Sector 7 since 1935, where he was used to reverse engineer technologies including the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, and cars (timestamp 1:37:31). This means that the engineers who developed all of these new technologies actually stole the technology from Megatron and wrongfully claimed the intellectual property as their own. Carl Benz applied for a patent for his “vehicle powered by a gas engine” in 1886, almost 50 years before Megatron was discovered on Earth [3]. Therefore, it must have been modern upgrades to cars that were reverse engineered from Megatron and not the initial invention of the car itself. Based on the timing of when the first microchip was invented in 1958, the first laser in 1960, and NASA’s first human spaceflight in 1961, it is possible that these technological advances were reverse engineered over the 25 years between 1935 and 1960 [4,5,6]. While society may have benefited from these technological advancements, inventors should have given some acknowledgement or credit to Megatron’s role in the development of technology. Hopefully these engineers were careful when reverse engineering alien technology and made sure they fully understood what they were creating.</p>
					<p>One other reference to intellectual property rights is in the scene where Maggie and Glen are being interrogated by the FBI (timestamp 1:08:20). Glen tries to prove his innocence by saying “I have done nothing bad in my entire life!...so what? I’ve downloaded a couple thousand songs off the internet. Who hasn’t?”. Glen is correct that a lot of people illegally download music, especially around the time when Transformers came out in 2007. Illegal music downloads have resulted in many lost sales for the music industry and from 1999 to 2009 total revenue from music sales dropped from $14.6 billion to $6.3 billion [1]. Although many people illegally download music, the Recording Industry Association of America was still able to sue individuals for doing so. For example, in 2009 a single mother, Jammie Thomas-Rassert, was ordered to pay $1.92 million for violating copyrights of 24 songs [2]. Downloading music illegally may not be something the FBI would be interrogating Glen for, but Glen’s assumption that illegally downloading music is innocent just because many other people do it would not hold up in court.</p>
