						<h1>Analysis</h1>
					</header>
					<p>After watching Transformers, a surprising number of interesting conclusions can be drawn with regards to technology and how we use it. The movie holds up well, and even hits on many relevant issues we face today such as information privacy, government censorship, and network security. While we may not be at war with intelligent robots, the movie gives us lessons on how we deal with pressing technological issues.</p>
					<p>Throughout the plot of the movie, the government played a major role in how things played out. The military was always quick to respond to threats, mobilizing when necessary in order to protect humanity. Being able to make hard decisions during rough times can ensure the safety of the people and help establish a positive future. While protecting the people is a positive aspect of the government, it has some negative aspects too. During the movie sector 7, a secret government agency, was devoted to keeping transformers a secret, and using the information to benefit themselves. They held both the Allspark and Megatron, using them to develop and sell new technology. That isn’t so bad, but the fact that they kept an alien race and their technology hidden on earth, while suppressing anyone who tries to find out, can’t be considered good. This movie showed us that the government plays an important role in keeping us safe, but that can come at the cost of censored information.</p>
					<p>A specific use of technology that was used to our benefit during the movie was communication. While stationed in Qatar, soldiers used video chat to talk to their families, making deployment a little less hard on them. The usefulness of communication is really shown when they use shortwave radio to get a signal out after the internet and phone lines were taken down. Different methods of communication are used for different applications, but the simple act of being able to relay information to one another is what helped them turn the tides against the deceptions. Even today, humans are much more capable when they can effectively and efficiently communicate with each other.</p>
					<p>A hot topic being discussed today is information privacy, and there is a great example of how your information can be used against you in transformers. Sam is trying to sell some of his grandfather’s items on eBay, but he accidentally uploads the glasses that include the map to the Allspark. Both sides of the transformers use this to target Sam, ultimately putting his life in great danger. While he did not use his real name in his username, his information can be easily found on his eBay page, which was the mistake that got him into this mess. If he had been more careful about the information he posted online, he may have been able to avoid confrontations with the transformers. Sam’s experiences with eBay showed him that bad things can happen if you post the wrong information on the internet.</p>
					<p>The last important topic brought up by this movie is computer and network security. During the attack in Qatar, bad design of their onsite network almost gave the Decepticons the location of the Allspark. This happens once again when Frenzy hacks into the pentagon using a highly advanced computer virus. The attacks in this movie are mainly based in science fiction, but they can easily be related to modern day security. Networks as important as our government’s need strong security and reliability to protect against harmful cyber-attacks.</p>
					<p>Transformers is an interesting watch when you consider the implications behind the technologies featured in the film. It’s easy to draw connections to modern day, with important lessons to be learned.</p>
