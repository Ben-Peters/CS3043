						<h1>Privacy and the Government</h1>
					</header>
					<p>Government and privacy play a large role in Transformers throughout the plot. Whether it is restricting information from the public, or monopolizing decisions towards how to act, it's clear in the movie that the common people have very little say in what happens.</p>
					<p>In Transformers, the government goes very far to hide all information regarding transformers from the public, essentially privatizing all information and technology related to them. A great example of this is sector 7, where they were holding Megatron and the cube. Very few people know about this location and what it has inside, and the people who do must adhere to very strict rules.  They use sector 7 and whatâ€™s inside to reverse engineer technology and weapons so they can be used by humans, but mainly the government.</p>
					<p>Another good example of the government keeping key information private is how they actively suppress people from finding the truth. While Sam tries to find the glasses, sector 7 agents show up at his house and arrest him since he has had contact with the Autobots. Something very similar happens when Maggie takes the sound clip to Glen, agents show up in a matter of minutes, seizing both the people and the information. This shows the lengths at which the government is willing to go to stop the spread of information.</p>
					<p>While privacy is important in the movie, the government does other things to impact the plot of the movie as well. They know that the average person can do very little against the threat that Transformers face, so the military steps in to protect. Fast mobilization and constant surveillance by the military is the only thing stopping widespread chaos. During the second attack on Qatar, it only takes a call from Colonel William to dispatch multiple fighter jets and heavy weaponry to the area. Same thing goes for the fight in Las Vegas, with tanks on the streets and teams trying to take out the Decepticons. All this shows how powerful the military and government are, and that they play a key role in protecting everyone during the movie.</p>
