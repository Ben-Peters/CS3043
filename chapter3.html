						<h1>Chapter 3: Networked Communications</h1>
					</header>
					<p>An overarching theme of this movie was that being able to quickly and easily communicate is very important to having a coordinated and effective counterattack. This is explicitly stated in the movie shortly after a virus planted in the Department of Defense’s network essentially takes the entire internet offline as well as all phones. The characters realize that this lack of communication put them at a serious disadvantage in fighting off the upcoming attack. As a solution to this they revert to using older technology that was not impacted by the virus such as shortwave radio to be able to still communicate without the internet or phone lines.</p>
					<blockquote>Thats why the virus shut us down, so we can't coordinate against their next attack. Which I would bet my ridiculous government salary is comming.<br>-Tom Banacheck</blockquote>
					<p>One of the first ways we see characters communicate in the movie is by using a video chat service. This service is used by Lt. Colonel Lennox to see his wife and daughter while being deployed. The call is interrupted when the base is attacked, and this is the last time that his wife sees him before he is presumed dead from the attack. By having this type of service available it meant that deployed service members were able to communicate and stay connected to their families easier making it easier on both groups to be deployed. Without this network they would have to rely on phone calls and emails which don’t carry nearly as much of an emotional connection as a video call.</p>
					<p>One of the most used forms of networked communication is the use of phones. Phones are used most often as a backup form of communication. This can be seen clearly when after the army base is attacked and Lennox and his team go to the nearest village to find a cellphone so they can contact the Pentagon to report they are still alive and get support. Additionally, we see the clever use of a cell phone when Tom Banacheck a member of a secret government department uses his cell phone on speaker to alert other agents that he and his team need more agents to deal with the Autobots. Another use of cell phones is the main character Sam Witwicky uses his phone to record a goodbye message to the world when he finds out his car is alive. This recording tips off Banacheck and his partner Simmons that Sam may have been in contact with a Transformer which causes Sam and his family and love interest to be arrested and taken away. Cell phones both helped in the fight against the Decepticons as well as possibly harming the fight. Without cell phones the survivors of the base attack would not have gotten the air support they needed and would have all been killed without being able to pass on any of the information they gathered about the Decepticon that attacked them. On the other hand, when Banachek uses his phone on speaker he slows the Autobots and Sam from being able to stop the Decepticons.</p>
					<p>Another major form of communication throughout the movie is the use of radios. Radios are often used to communicate between ground personnel as well as being used to communicate with aircraft. Additionally, after the internet is taken offline shortwave radios are used to communicate between different air force bases. Radios allow for instant and reliable communication between anyone who is within range. If the characters in the movie were unable to use radios, there is certainly no way that they would have been able to defeat the Decepitcons. Radios were the only viable form of communication after the internet went down. Because of this they were crucial to being able to coordinate the movements of aircraft and other assets used to defeat the Decepticons.</p>
