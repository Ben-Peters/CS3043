						<h1>Chapter 10: Work and Wealth</h1>
					</header>
					<p>One of the few parts of the movie that relates to work and wealth is the outsourcing of the call center for the cell phone company. We see that when Lt. Colonel Lennox uses a borrowed cell phone to get in contact with the Pentagon that he first must go through a call center to pay for his call. While this is mostly added for comedic relief it does reflect the state of the world where call centers have been outsourced to India. If the call center was in the United States it is more likely that the call would have been put through to the Pentagon without requiring a credit card making it faster to get help and possibly saving lives. Besides this reference there was little comment about work and wealth within the movie.</p>
					<p>The other part of the movie that relates to work and wealth is the role of sentient machines. While this topic doesnâ€™t play a large role in this movie it does play a larger role in the later movies. This question is also important to think about for today. The Transformers are clearly able to feel emotions like joy and sadness when they lose friends. What is it that gives people the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and does it extend beyond humans to machines that can think and feel? While these themes are not explicitly discussed in the movie we do see a variety of responses. Some people like Sam clearly feel that they deserve the same respect and treatment as humans do while others like Sector Seven refuse to even acknowledge that NBE-1 (Non-Biological Extraterrestrial 1 a.k.a. Megatron) has a name or any rights. As technology and artificial intelligence improve it is going to become important to determine if these machines deserve any rights and if they do what their rights are and how far do they extend. This question is even more important in the context of the movie because the Transformers are more powerful than humans not only technologically but also physically so denying them rights may cause conflict.</p>
