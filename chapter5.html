					<p>The Autobots were very easily able to figure out that Sam was Archibald Witwicky’s grandson and that Sam had the glasses they were looking for. At first Sam does not understand how the Autobots know so much about his grandfather and he asks “How’d you know about his glasses?”. Optimus Prime responds with one word, “Ebay” (timestamp 1:06:20). The Autobots discovering Sam’s Ebay page is a necessary plot point to push the story forward and explain why the Autobots know so much about Sam.</p>
					<p>The Decepticon named Frenzy was also able to quickly find Sam’s Ebay page by making a Yahoo Search of the name “Witwicky” (timestamp 0:33:10). Sam did use the username “LadiesMan217” instead of using his real name. However, the welcome blurb on his Ebay page says “Welcome to the Witwicky Family Store!” and “My first name is Sam” so anyone could easily figure out that this Ebay page belonged to him (timestamp 0:33:19). Frenzy was then able to use this information to find Sam’s location by searching the police database. Frenzy finding Sam was also critical to the plot of this movie since it allowed Frenzy to disguise himself as Mikaela’s phone to be brought with Sam and Mikaela to Sector Seven.</p>
					<p>If the Decepticons and the Autobots had not seen the image of Captain Witwicky’s glasses on Sam’s Ebay, the Transformers may have never realized Sam’s connection to the Allspark. Sam’s experience with the Transformers may lead him to be more conscious of what personal information he puts on his Ebay page in the future.</p>
